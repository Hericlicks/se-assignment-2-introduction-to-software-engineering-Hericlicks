Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity is the design principle of breaking down a software system into smaller, self-contained units called modules. Each module encapsulates a specific functionality or a set of related functions and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces.

How Modularity Improves Maintainability:

Isolation of Changes:

Changes in one module have minimal impact on others.
Easier to identify and fix bugs or add new features without affecting the entire system.

Simplified Testing:

Each module can be tested independently.
Reduces complexity and improves the reliability of tests.

Clear Organization:

Code is organized in logical units, making it easier to understand and navigate.
New developers can quickly grasp the structure and purpose of different parts of the system.
How Modularity Improves Scalability:

Independent Development:

Multiple teams can work on different modules simultaneously.
Speeds up development and allows for parallel progress.

Reusability:

Modules can be reused in different parts of the system or in other projects.
Reduces duplication and accelerates development.
Performance Optimization:

Individual modules can be optimized without overhauling the entire system.
Allows for targeted performance improvements.
Flexible Scaling:

Modules can be scaled independently based on their specific demands.
More efficient use of resources and better performance management.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing).

Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions in isolation. It verifies that each unit of the code works correctly. Typically performed by developers.

Integration Testing: Focuses on the interactions between integrated units or modules. It checks if combined components work together as expected.

System Testing: Evaluates the complete, integrated system to ensure it meets the specified requirements. It tests the entire system’s functionality and performance.

Acceptance Testing: Determines if the software meets the end-user requirements and is ready for release. It often involves user scenarios to validate the software from the user’s perspective.
